# MCPI-Skyblock
A ported Skyblock for Minecraft: Pi edition

![image](skyblock.png)

## Before playing
This world is meant for [MCPI-Reborn](https://github.com/MCPI-Revival/minecraft-pi-reborn) **ONLY.**

The reason for this is because the starter chest contains a bucket of lava which isn't in normal MCPI or MCPE 0.6.1.

Because of this, make sure you are using MCPI-Reborn 2.4.0 or later.

Also I'd recommend setting your render distance to normal or far as the sand island has been moved to 64 blocks away from spawn.

## How to install
Extract Skyblock.zip to `~/.miencraft-pi/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds`

## What's new
Moved sand island to X:64 Y:0 Z:0 (centered)

Moved cactus to left side of sand island

Moved chest to center of sand island

Removed water at world border

Added tall grass to starter island

Changed items in chests

Changed spawn tree to be natual
