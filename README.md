# MCPI-Skyblock
A ported Skyblock for Minecraft: Pi edition

## Before playing
This world is meant for [MCPI-Reborn](https://github.com/MCPI-Revival/minecraft-pi-reborn) **ONLY.**
The reason for this is because the starter chest contains a bucket of lava which is not in normal MCPI or MCPE 0.6.1
Because of this, make sure you are using MCPI-Reborn 2.4.0 or later
